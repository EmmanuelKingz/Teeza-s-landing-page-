                <article class="meat">
                    Meat is a valuable source of high biological value protein, iron, vitamin B12 as well as other B 
                    complex vitamins, zinc, selenium and phosphorus. Fat content and fatty acid profile, a constant 
                    matter of concern when referring to meat consumption, is highly dependent on species, feeding system 
                    as well as the cut used.
                    Meat is an excellent source of protein, which is essential for any healthy diet. It helps build and 
                    repair muscle as well as help maintain them.

                            Red meat are classified as muscle meat from beef, pork, lamb, goat, or other land mammals.
                            On one hand, red meat is a good source of certain nutrients, especially vitamin B-12 and iron. 
                            The human body needs these nutrients to produce new red blood cells.
                            Red meat is also high in protein, which is necessary for building muscle, bone, other tissues, 
                            and enzymes.
                            Red meat contains nutrients that are beneficial to health, including iron, vitamin B-12, and zinc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            White meat is reportedly good for managing cholesterol due to its high levels of polyunsaturated 
                            and monounsaturated fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6, generally found in fish. These fatty 
                            acids balance LDL cholesterol with HDL cholesterol. White meat is generally high in Vitamin B, 
                            particularly B3 and B12 for brain function and blood health. Other poultry like turkey, duck and 
                            goose are also high in protein, zinc, iron, vitamin B and magnesium.
                            White meat is a great addition to any healthy plate, and familiar foods like chicken is an easy 
                            way to introduce healthy meats into your family’s dinner rotation.

                    Clothes are hygienic barriers that insulate against cold or hot conditions, keep infectious and toxic materials 
                    away from the body and the protect our feet from injury and discomfort. Fashion and dress can give us mobility and visibility 
                    can startle or move us; they can shift us from our comfort zones and make us think differently about ourselves and others. 
                    Clothes influence how we look at someone thereby creating an idea of what we think about their personality. Wearing what makes you 
                    comfortable is a statement, and people will respect your individuality.

                    Sport isn’t just a good way to keep our bodies healthy, but it also has psychological benefits 
                    and teaches us important life skills too. Organised sport has many psychological and social benefits 
                    for children and adults – even more than the physical activity during play.
                    Sports equipment and facilities enable the sportsmen and sportswomen to perform at their best of 
                    abilities. Low-quality athletic equipment hampers your play, which makes it difficult to see how 
                    and where you’re improving. But with high-quality gear, you can see and understand much more about 
                    how you’re doing.

                    Restaurants provide a sense of camaraderie and community. There are always certain restaurants in 
                    any town that everyone knows. Not only do they know the place, they know the people who work there 
                    or own it. In some ways, the sense of community created makes the restaurant as important to locals 
                    as their own kitchens.
                    Our Eatery department will certainly provide “U” with a unique environment for the impactful gathering 
                    of friends and communities, where relationships form and memories are made.

                    The rise in technological advances and innovation has led to the creation of unique products and 
                    as well, an incremental upgrade of extant technologies. Smart phones rep one of the fruits of these 
                    innovations and comes packed with a whole lot of benefits.
                    It has become a combination of a computer, telephone, and camera. Smart phones often have Internet 
                    access, texting abilities, memory for photos and other information, and much more.

                    The bond between humans and animals is not just good for human health, it can also help build community. 
                    People with pets often find that activities with their companion animal creates connections with other 
                    people. Because of the companionship that pets bring, endeavour to take adequate care of their nutrition 
                    and health.
